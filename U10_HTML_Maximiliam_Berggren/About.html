            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              We started of as a small grill on an island in the archipelago of Stockholm back in 1974. Back then we only served small and simple burgers, but the thing was that it was not just small and simple burgers, it was great burgers! We evolved and grew every year to become what we are today. Today we serve 500+ guest a day even better burgers. Today we have a loving staff who work to serve the most delicious of meats. Today we work to keep the holy spirit of the burger alive. Today we are MaxBBQ.
